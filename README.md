# Replicating Blanchard & Quah (1989)

Authors of the replication : Andrea Giannino(andrea.giannino@carloalberto.org) and Davide Zagame(davide.zagame@carloalberto.org).

We replicate the main findings of [Blanchard & Quah,1989](https://uh.edu/~bsorense/BlanchardQuah1989.pdf).

## Reproducing the results
The first step is to download the package BQ_1989_Replication. 
For that, open the command terminal (making sure Julia is already added to PATH) :

```
> git clone https://github.com/dzagame/BQ_1989_Replication.jl.git
> cd BQ_1989_Replication.jl
> julia # to turn on the Julia REPL
```
Then, when in the Julia REPL, simply run:
```
julia > ]
julia > activate .

using BQ_1989_Replication

BQ_1989_Replication.run()
```

## Folder organisation

The folders are organised as follow:

```
├── README.md          <- Read-me file
│
├── data               <- Folder containing the data employed by B&Q (quarterly GDP and unemployment growth rates in the US - Q21948 to Q41987)
│   
├── reference         <- Includes the original B&Q paper and the Matlab replication code by Ambrogio Cesa-Bianchi
|
├── output             <- Output generated by the replication package.
│    ├── figures       <- Contains the figures in pdf format.
│    └── tables        <- Contains the tables in pdf format.
│
├── test               <- Contains the unit test files.
│
└── src                <- Source code for use in this project.
```

## Computational Requirements

We indicate here the minimum resources used for replication on our own devices. Expected run time may vary depending on your own machine.

*OS*: Windows 11

*CPU*: Intel i5 1145G7 - 2.6Ghz 

*RAM* : 16 GB

*GPU*: 128 MB

*Software version* : Julia 1.11.3 (2025-01-21)

## Expected run time

Given our specifications, the runtime of BQ_1989_Replication.run() is of about 3 minutes.
