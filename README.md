# Replication package for Blanchard,O.J & Quah,D. (AER, 1989) in Julia

**Authors of the replication** : Andrea Giannino (andrea.giannino@carloalberto.org) and Davide Zagame (davide.zagame@carloalberto.org).

**Course:** Computational Economics, Spring 2025 - Master in Economics, Collegio Carlo Alberto

We replicate the main findings of [Blanchard, Olivier Jean and Quah, Danny. "The Dynamic Effects of Aggregate Demand and
Supply Disturbances." The American Economic Review 79, no.4 (1989): 655-673](https://uh.edu/~bsorense/BlanchardQuah1989.pdf).

## Reproducing the results
The first step is to download the package BQ_1989_Replication. 
For that, open the command terminal (making sure Julia is already added to PATH) :

```
> git clone https://github.com/dzagame/BQ_1989_Replication.jl.git
> cd BQ_1989_Replication.jl
> julia # to turn on the Julia REPL
```
Then, when in the Julia REPL, simply run:
```
julia > ]
(@v1.11) pkg> activate .

julia> using BQ_1989_Replication

julia> BQ_1989_Replication.run() #To run the replication and obtain the IRFs
julia> BQ_1989_Replication.runtests() #To run the unit tests
```

## Folder organisation

The folders are organised as follow:

```
├── README.md          <- Read-me file
│
├── data               <- Folder containing the data employed by B&Q (quarterly GDP and unemployment growth rates in the US - Q21948 to Q41987)
│   
├── reference         <- Includes the original B&Q paper and the Matlab replication code by Ambrogio Cesa-Bianchi
|
├── output             <- Output generated by the replication package.
│    ├── figures       <- Contains the figures in pdf format.
│    └── tables        <- Contains the tables in pdf format.
│
├── test               <- Contains the unit test files.
│
└── src                <- Source code for use in this project.
```

## Computational Requirements

We indicate here the computational resources employed for replication. Expected run time may vary depending on your own machine.

*OS*: Windows 11

*CPU*: Intel i5 1145G7 - 2.6Ghz 

*RAM* : 16 GB

*GPU*: 128 MB

*Software version* : Julia 1.11.3 (2025-01-21)

## Expected run time

Given the above-mentioned specifications, the runtime of BQ_1989_Replication.run() is of about 3 minutes.
